    <h2>Switching from mining for fuel to mining for data.</h2>

    <h3>Call me digug. By the time you know what you want me to dig for you, I will have already dug it.</h3>

    <h4>After 11 years of working as a geophysicist, I have decided to mine for data not fuel and become a data
    analyst/scientist. As a seismic data analyst, I have developed skills such as working on multiple projects at once,
    working on large projects in a complex environment, exceptional team player, and highly organized and detail-oriented. I
    have a bachelors degree in Applied Mathematics and am currently taking a Data Analysis boot camp course through DU. I
    enjoy working in python and digging through data, I have a knack for critical thing and quick mapping out solutions to
    problems. I can quickly learn new programming languages and software. Experienced in Excel, VBA, Python, & SQL. I am
    conversationally fluent on Mandarin Chinese.</h4>
